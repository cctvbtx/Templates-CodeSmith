# JavaScript Region Testing

## Summary
Trying to understand how to use a Preserve Region with a Merge Strategy in CodeSmith Generator.

### Problem
While using a Merge Strategy the file is never rendered.  Initially I thought this may be caused by the `OutputType` directive.  I've tried using `OutputType="None"`, `OutputType="Normal"`, and even removing the parameter entirely.  Nothing has worked.  I was able to perform a merge once, using the syntax in the two files, but cannot duplicate the results.
