# Mongoose Model Template v0.1.1

## Summary

### Background
Provides data logic methods for simplifying data access.  Allows for dynamically replacing lengthy variable names with shortened versions within the MongoDB database.  Will eventually be used in conjunction with a cleaner web service template.

### Status
In development.  Initial creation uploaded to repository.  Testing beginning.

## Requirements

### General
SQL Server and CodeSmith Generator v7.0 is needed for generation.  Earlier versions of Generator may also work.  NodeJS and the Node Package Manager ("npm") must be installed to setup the generated code base.

### Development
Template designed to run in CodeSmith Generator, a Windows-only product.  Once generated the codebase should run in any environment that supports NodeJS.

### Production
Generated code based runs in any environment supporting NodeJS.

## Deviations

## Future Goals
Need to improve with feedback from experienced Mongoose / MongoDB developers.  Should also add methods for paging and other advanced features.

## Updates
### v0.1.1
- Added `index.js` and master template
