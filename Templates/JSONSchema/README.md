# JSON Schema Template v0.1.0

## Summary

### Background
Exports database schema into a JSON document (not a JSON schema).  Expected use is with custom generators not having a DB connection.

### Status
Experimental but seemingly complete.  Has been tested. 

## Requirements

### General
CodeSmith Generator v7.0 is needed for generation.  Earlier versions may also work.  

### Development
Template designed to run in CodeSmith Generator, a Windows-only product.  

### Production
Any JSON parser may use the .json document.  Equivilent .js file should be usable in any JavaScript environment (NodeJS, etc.).

## Deviations

## Future Goals
Will probably be used as a resource template to other master templates.

## Updates
None... yet.
